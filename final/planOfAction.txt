Plan of Action:
1.Analyze Jeff’s pong code 
2.Can we get game to start with the view we want (i.e ball starts at center, correct layout of score and controls visuals) 
3.Can we get the ball to move 
	a.Can we get the ball to move in a random direction 
4.Game has a game over if ball touches the bottom of the screen 
	a.Game has restart button on game over (that actually restarts the game) 
5.Implement blocks so that they are placed in game at start. 
6.Implement blocks so that they can be placed by player input 
	a.Make blocks movable with WASD/arrow key before the ball starts moving 
	b.Spawn a new block when a player finalizes the location of the previous block by hitting the enter key 
3.Could additionally make blocks breakable and make blocks have different shapes 
7.Draw the arrow in the correct direction 
	a.Arrow shows direction of balls (randomly generated) initial velocity 
8.Make sure timer and score works 
9.Allow player to change difficulty (number of blocks available to place) 
10.Change the models of ball and blocks to look more appealing 
	a.Effects when ball hits blocks(?)
